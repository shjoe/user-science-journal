          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>For this usability analysis, I will be outlining <a href="https://www.uzairways.com/"
              target="_blank">Uzbekistan
              Airways</a>. Uzbekistan Airway is, as its name
            suggests, is an airline. The primary business is flight travel and as such, websites proving any service
            should be easy to navigate and have a clear, understandable UI for customers to be able to purchase services
            and goods. For this reason, I will analyze these four key criteria: navigation, clear content, mobile
            development, and visual hierarchy.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Navigation</h2>

          <p>Most if not all airline websites give users the ability to sign up for accounts to track their flights,
            rewards, and other information related to the airline and flights. When navigating to Uzbekistan Airway’s
            website it would appear as if they do not grant this opportunity to users. Sign in/sign up links and boxes
            are generally displayed near the top right of the page.</p>

          <p>On this page, users will have to navigate to the
            “UzAirPlus” tab, where a set of menu options will be displayed. From there, users can click “Become a
            member” or “My account.”</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post1/uz-nav.png" alt="Uzbekistan Airways Navigation">

          <span class="caption text-muted">Note that users have to navigate to UzAirPlus on the right, navigate back to
            the left side of the screen, and click on desired page.</span>

          <p>Compare this with <a href="https://www.alaskaair.com/" target="_blank">Alaska Airlines</a> website and we
            can see a stark
            difference. To
            access an account or sign up for one, users can navigate to the top right of the screen where it is easily
            accessible.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post1/aa-nav.PNG" alt="Alaksa Airlines Navigation">

          <span class="caption text-muted">Note that users only have to navigate and click on the top right hand side of
            the screen.</span>

          <p>To easily remedy this inconvenience, Uzbekistan Airways could create easy access links next to
            their search box as there is quite a bit of real estate in that section of their page. Aside from a few
            issues with placement of content and perhaps having a problem of having too many options, this page has a
            fairly straight forward navigation. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Clear Content</h2>

          <p>It seems unfair to judge an airline from Uzbekistan with a western perspective. However, on a general
            usability level, I found that the main service that was being promoted was presented to customers in a
            confusing manner. For example, if I wanted to book a flight from New York (JFK) to Tashkent (TAS) on the
            days the airline has available flights, there is a wide range of fares and it’s not clear to me why there is
            such a range. Finding flights was easy enough but picking between different fares? Not so much.</p>

          <p>The easiest difference to discern is the jump from economy class to business class, this is
            common amongst all airlines. What is confusing is why there are one “promo economy class”, four “excursion
            economy class” and one “basic economy class,” all with different fares ranging from $478.80 USD to $938.70
            USD for the same exact flight.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post1/uz-content.PNG" alt="Uzbekistan Airways Fares">

          <span class="caption text-muted">On the left hand side of this page, you can see the similar classes of
            flight. Note however, the different booking classes/prices with no explanation. </span>

          <p>Alaska Airlines also has multiple fare classes but on the booking screen, it
            is clearly laid out that there are 3 different fares: saver, main, and first class with prices corresponding
            to the fare as well as alternate flights.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post1/aa-content.PNG" alt="Alaska Airlines Fares">

          <span class="caption text-muted">Fares, classes, and flights are separated into an easily understandable
            layout.</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Mobile Development</h2>

          <p>At first glance, the mobile version of Uzbekistan Airway’s page looks good. The menu is condensed into a 3
            x 3 grid with images and text that clearly state what it’s intended use is for. I prefer the mobile page
            over the desktop version. The difference between the two being how “loud” the page is. </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post1/uz-mobile.PNG" alt="Uzbekistan Airways Mobile">

          <p>On mobile, the page displays the crucial elements. The page looks uniform with the grid laid out with blue
            menu boxes. On desktop, there is juxtaposition of empty space and crowded space which results in an uneven
            flow to the page. I would imagine to the average user; the focus of this page is the menu section and the
            top navigation bar. The rest of the page seems to be full of unnecessary logos, images, and information that
            would be suited for a dedicated sub-page.</p>

          <p>In this instance, the mobile development highlights issues that the desktop version suffers from. If there
            is one thing I would suggest in improving the mobile UI, it would be to place the menu item “Tickets online”
            on the top left. I found myself wandering to the top left to find out where I could book tickets but instead
            found the flight timetable, while useful, not what I wanted.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Visual Hierarchy</h2>

          <p>Lets talk about something that I think this page nails and that is visual hierarchy. Users follow an
            F-pattern when scanning a page and this page is laid out in such a way to maximize this. We can see this as
            the navigation bar is strewn across the top. Below that is the main content which is the searching and
            booking flight menu.</p>

          <p>The "meat" of the page is located on the left hand side, an area where we draw our attention to. It took me
            a while to realize that even though I was on the EN page, some of the content was in Uzbek. I didn't pay
            attention to the right hand side of the page.</p>

          <p>This page follows a lot of industry standard conventions such as logos situated on the top left, F-pattern
            layout, and the bottom portion of the page dedicated to important (but information/links not important to
            the "user experience"). Like I mentioned earlier, it might be better to trunacate some of the excess
            elements of the page and focus on the main content for clean visual implementation.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post1/uz-visual.PNG" alt="Uzbekistan Airways Visual">

          <span class="caption text-muted">F-pattern highlighted in green.</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>

          <p>Honestly, if we apply usability guidelines to any website, good or bad, we could probably go in an endless
            cycle of optimizing in accordance to what we see fit. A lot of my suggestions and issues with Uzbekistan
            Airways' website can be seen as nitpicks, to which I completely understand. In the end, this airline's
            website works and for a lot of people, that's all that matters.</p>

          <p>My understanding of "good design" could differ from others so it seems like a moot point to try and appease
            everyone (think of all the time that would go into design and implementation if that was the case!). I think
            the main goal here is to find something that works and apply changes if the benefits outweigh the amount of
            work that goes into it.
