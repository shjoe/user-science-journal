          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>For this week’s Usability Test, I decided to have participants test out a specific feature on
            <a href="https://www.zoo.org/" target="_blank">Woodland Park Zoo's website.</a> Specifically, I wanted to
            test how effective this website is in allowing users to make the best, informed choices when signing up and
            purchasing membership plans. When I first read through the membership plans, I noticed that the way in which
            the content was presented, someone could be misled into purchasing a membership that isn’t the most cost
            beneficial. </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Method and Tasks</h2>
          <p>The method in which I invoked in testing this was to guide and document three individuals ‘experience in
            going through the process of choosing and signing up for memberships. I broke this up into three different
            tasks:
            <ol>
              <li>Navigate to the membership page</li>
              <li>Choose and sign up for the best membership that fits your current situation.
              <li>Choose the best membership that would fit this scenario: 2 parents, 1 child, and 1 non-related adult
                such as a nanny or babysitter. </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>The first two tasks are very straight-forward while the final task requires a little more thinking behind
            the decision process. I wanted to highlight two different scenarios when signing up for a membership; one
            in which the membership option is simple and the other, where the option is not quite that clear-cut. In
            order to give all participants the same experience, I folowed <a href="img/post3/test-script.pdf"
              target="_blank">this
              script.</a></p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Background Info</h2>
          <p>My participants agreed to meet me at a coffee shop near downtown Seattle. I chose a smaller, quieter shop
            in order to emulate the same experience someone would have at home as opposed to a busier, noisier
            surrounding. I had three participants in total ranging from the ages 22 – 29. In total there were two
            males and one female that participated in this test. One identified as a student (important later) while
            the other two worked in the tech industry in some capacity. All identified as avid web users with a slight
            lean towards mobile web. </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">First Task: Let's Navigate</h2>
          <p>In the first task, all participants were able to easily navigate to the membership page which is not a
            surprise because each participant were given two minutes to browse the home page. I was timing how long it
            took for a task to be completed but each participant was able to navigate through one click at the top of
            the page. While I gave each participant a two-minute break in between each task, I told them that they
            could read or explore the page so long as they stayed within the membership page.

            <span class="caption text-muted">Membership page can easily be accesible through the navigation items at
              the top. Average time to complete: < 1 second.</span> </p> <h2 class="section-heading">Second Task: Sign
                Me Up!</h2>
                <p>The results of the second task were like the first. Each participant was asked to select a
                  membership that would best apply to them. All three chose the annual pass for one adult. In order to
                  help
                  simulate the process of purchasing a membership, I gave them information that they could enter on the
                  required fields and proceed to check out, only stopping them at the payment screen. Having told them
                  to think
                  out loud and verbalize their thoughts, it was a mostly quiet for the first two tasks. When I reminded
                  one participant that they can think out loud, they responded with “I don’t have to think for this.”
                  The
                  average time to complete this task was roughly 33 seconds.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post3/test-2.jpg" alt="Test 2: Annual Pass Membership">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Simple sign up page. Average time to complete: 33 seconds.</span>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Third Task: Hmmmm...</h2>
                <p> The third task presented to my participants brought some mixed results. I instructed them to find
                  the best membership plan that would apply to a family of two adults, one child, and one adult who is
                  not
                  related to the family but acts as a caretaker to the child in some form or another. Two of my
                  participants, B and C, selected the same base annual plan and added the required number of adults
                  and children to the plan. The price for that plan came out to $206.00. I noticed that both
                  participants
                  didn’t even bother looking at other member options or even think out loud to themselves. These two
                  averaged
                  28 seconds- an improvement from the previous task in terms of speed. The other participant, A,
                  selected
                  the family passport option, which is a plan for two adults, one child, and one flexible guest (adult)
                  for the price of $195.00. This participant took 1 minute and 10 seconds to come to this decision and
                  actually read out loud the different membership options and did the math out loud to calculate how
                  much it would
                  cost.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post3/test-3.jpg" alt="Test 3: Specific Scenario">
                <span class="caption text-muted">All the membership options available. Average time to complete: 42
                  seconds.</span>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Interpreting Results</h2>
                <p>While all three completed each task, Participant A made all the “correct” decisions. Participants B
                  and C, while completing the final task in half the time as Participant A, did not realize that they
                  could have saved money by choosing a different membership option thus both failing to choose the best
                  membership for that specific scenario.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post3/correct.jpg" alt="Correct Membership">
                <span class="caption text-muted">The Family Passport was the "correct" decision in task 3.</span>
                <p>I think there a few factors that I believe are involved in the decision-making thought process.
                  First, when you get to the membership page, the “Annual Pass” option is expanded and takes up most the
                  page. When I followed up Participants B and C about why they didn’t explore other options, B told me
                  that they
                  had no idea there were any other options and that the build your own membership seemed like the only
                  option. C told me that they thought that the other options were premade membership options that you
                  could
                  easily make through the annual pass and it wasn’t clear as there were no instructions or indication
                  one
                  would save you more over the other. Participant A, on the other hand, took the time to click through
                  all
                  the options but found it “weird” that they had to do the math when it should have been clearly laid
                  out
                  in front of them which option is the best. In fact, Participant A, who just happens to be a student,
                  didn’t realize that at the bottom of the page, there is student discount for those who sign up in
                  person.
                  When brought to their attention after the fact, A told me “I was focused on trying to do the math to
                  make
                  my decision, I didn’t really think about anything else [on the page].”</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post3/discount.jpg" alt="Discount Notice">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Missed student discount.</span>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                <p> My opinion on this website feature, is simple, it needs more testing with different demographics.
                  It would be helpful to bring in people who have families of different sizes to see what their behavior
                  is when selecting a membership option. As it stands, there is potential for people to sign up for a
                  membership that cost them more than another type. One thing that Participant A brought to my
                  attention is that some memberships have different benefits than others which might impact people’s
                  decision
                  making. As Woodland Park Zoo attracts diverse demographics, it could do well with more usability
                  testing across
                  a wide range of demographics of users.</p>
