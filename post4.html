          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>In continuation of last week’s usability testing, I looked at how three participants interacted with
            <a href="https://www.zoo.org/" target="_blank">Woodland Park Zoo's website </a> on mobile. The oversight in
            which memberships were presented to users was the focus of this testing. If users were having issues on the
            desktop page, I wanted to see how they fared on mobile. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Method and Tasks</h2>
          <p>I used the <a href="img/post3/test-script.pdf" target="_blank">the same script</a> from last week in order
            to simulate the same conditions. The tasks stayed the same as well:
            <ol>
              <li>Navigate to the membership page</li>
              <li>Choose and sign up for the best membership that fits your current situation.
              <li>Choose the best membership that would fit this scenario: 2 parents, 1 child, and 1 non-related adult
                such as a nanny or babysitter. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, the setup slightly changed. Before, I was able to sit off to the side of the user and observe
              them using a laptop and simultaneously see the screen. In this week’s testing, I had them use my personal
              iPhone 8, a much smaller screen than a laptop. To avoid hovering over my participants, I decided to cast
              the phone through my AppleTV while sitting off to the side where I could see both the phone and the casted
              screen on a much larger tv screen.</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Background Info</h2>
            <p>The makeup of my participants this week, while still similar in age range 25 – 30 and work experience
              (all three tech), are either in a domestic partnership or married. One participant noted that they have a
              child with their significant other. </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">First Task: I Don’t Know Why I’m Testing This</h2>
            <p>To start things off, my participants were easily able to complete the first task with no problem. On
              mobile, the top of the page lists: tickets, membership, and donate. I didn’t bother to time this task, the
              time it took to complete this task seemed to be correlated to how quickly they could press a finger on the
              membership icon. Two users opted to do this testing with one hand, using their thumb to navigate and touch
              the screen to navigate. One user opted to hold the phone in their non-dominant hand (left) and use their
              right index finger to perform all actions.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post4/test-1.jpg" alt="Test 1: Navigate">
            <span class="caption text-muted">Nothing really of note here. Average time to complete: < 1 second.</span>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Second Task: Surprise, Surprise </h2>
                <p>Where the first ask took no time to complete, the second task made up for the lack of time. Last
                  week, the average time to complete this task was 33 seconds. In this week’s testing, the average time
                  to complete, was 1 minute 40 seconds. My main takeaway from this task was that all my participants
                  took the time to look through each and all options which, in my opinion, directly affected their
                  performance in the next task. I think it helped that the marital status of my participants was
                  different than my previous batch of participants. Listening to their thought process, I noticed that
                  they would bring up their significant other in consideration of how they fit into membership plans so
                  it seemed they had a genuine interest in the membership plans, something that may have been lacking in
                  my previous usability testing. Another factor in the longer times was the layout of the page on
                  mobile. To add members to a plan, the page would get cut off on the margins on the right. After some
                  scrolling, the participants were able to see the full page but it definitely hindered the process.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post4/test-2.jpg" alt="Test 2: Memberships">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Everyone picked a variation of the annual pass. Average time to
                  complete: 1 minute and 40 seconds. Note the cutoff at the right margin.</span>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Third Task: Maybe I Overreacted Last Week… </h2>
                <p>I was surprised by the final task’s outcomes. The average time to complete was less than the second
                  task’s average time at 55 seconds. All participants chose the correct plan in this task, the Family
                  Passport. In all three instances, the participants referred to the second task where they had already
                  figured out the differences in the membership plans. When one participant started building a plan
                  based off the annual membership plan, they noticed that they would be paying a higher price, so they
                  deleted the selected plan from their cart and went back to add the Family Passport. The problems that
                  were faced in the previous week, didn’t seem to be an issue here at all. </p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post4/test-3.jpg" alt="Test 3: Specific Scenario">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Success! Average time to complete: 55 seconds.</span>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Interpreting Results</h2>
                <p>The mindset of user determines how they interact or parse information. It’s a very simple thing to
                  note and not an earth-shattering observation or conclusion by any means. I was so caught up in trying
                  to prove the point that the way in which this website is set up, people might be misled into signing
                  up for the wrong membership, it didn’t dawn on me that this might not be a problem to people who don’t
                  have a vested interest in certain memberships. </p>
                <p>Single people or those who are married or are in a partnership with no children, for the most part,
                  don’t need to worry about the difference between the Annual Pass and the Family Passport. In fact, if
                  they only see the Annual Pass as on option, they will have saved themselves a lot of time from reading
                  unnecessary information. It dawned on me when I saw my participant who was married and has a child go
                  through this usability test that different people in different situations would respond differently.
                  In that particular instance, they had a vested interest in finding the best plan so they would go the
                  extra mile to read on to see all the option presented to them.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>So, was this usability testing a waste? Probably, it could go either way at this point. I would be
                  interested in the reasoning and thought process behind the layout of the membership page. Was it
                  something well thought out to have the Annual Pass be the default because that might fit most people’s
                  needs? Did I stumble upon something that wasn’t a problem that I made into a problem? Whatever it may
                  be, my three participants this week taught me that people will find a way to serve their needs.</p>
