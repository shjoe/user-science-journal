          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>In this week’s accessibility study, I will be looking at the <a href="https://www.ci.westport.wa.us/"
              target="_blank">website of Westport, WA </a>. Westport is a small
            town that is located on the coast of southwest Washington that I grew up in when I was younger. I thought it
            would be interesting to do an accessibility study on a website that serves the general public in providing
            information and resources, but I didn’t want to do one on a larger city like Seattle. Rather, a smaller town
            like Westport would probably have more issues with website accessibility than a city with the ability to
            allocate more resources to address the concerns that come up in this week’s study.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post5/home.jpg" alt="Westport, WA Homepage">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Looks like what you would expect from a small town website.</span>
          <p>In order to help me find and analyze this website, I used the <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/"
              target="_blank"> Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)</a>
            and
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#devtools" target="_blank"> Chrome’s Lighthouse
              tool</a> to run audits and cross referenced them with the <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/" target="_blank"> Web Content Accessibility
              Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>. I found that the website for Westport, WA has some glaring issues regarding
            content.
            I found that 1) the HTML lacked any type of structure through the lack of headings and 2) images, some
            links, and forms lacked alternative text. These issues could severely impact the way a screen reader
            presents this information to a user.</p>
          <h2>Headings</h2>
          <p>One of the things that stuck out the most when I ran WAVE and Lighthouse was the lack of structure,
            specifically there are no headings. I can understand that if you’re not using any kind of assisted
            screen reader, it would be easy to dismiss the lack of headings in the HTML structure. Having studied
            web development for a few quarters, I know that headings (e.g. h1, h2, h3, etc.) provide structure to a
            web page.</p>
          <p>Headings provides a hierarchy to sections of a page which is a crucial component of delivering
            information, not just stylistically but also in a reasonable manner. In the case of assisted technology,
            it helps the user navigate through the content of the page. In this website that would be near
            impossible due to the structure of the HTML file. Most of the content is written in the table tag and
            upon further review in Chrome’s dev tools, it’s a hot mess trying to find any kind of structure.</p>
          <p>I’ve gone through a few of the pages and links and have yet to find any p tags. All the text is
            rendered through tables, lists, or link tags. I can’t imagine how a screen reader would interpret this
            page.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post5/html.jpg" alt="HTML File">
          <span class="caption text-muted">What is going on in this HTML file?</span>
          <h2>Alternative Text</h2>
          <p>On the home page, there are six images that do not have alt tags to provide a short description. This
            is also the case with a form tag and a few links. This may seem not seem like a big deal the browser
            will be unable to relay what the content of these things are due to a lack of text descriptions. While
            non-text content is visually presented to most users, it provides a huge road block to those that
            visually impaired. Alternative text is a means to remedy this issue.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post5/alternative-text.jpg" alt="Lack of Alternative Text">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Top: Example of an image lacking alternative text. Bottom: Lighthouse audit
            listing all instances of a lack of alternative text.</span>
          <p>There are a decent amount of important links, some that are linked by an image, that lack alternative text.
            For instance, Tsunami preparedness and info was always a big subject when I was living in Westport and it
            would be hard for a screen reader to be able to convey that an image links to important information. The
            user would have to use contextual clues to “guess” that the image linked to information related to Tsunamis
            due to being in a table that included Tsunami in the description. This is bad design, users shouldn’t have
            to guess where a link is going to take them.</p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>While I only focused on two accessibility issues on this website their impact goes beyond. The lack of
            structure and alternative text descriptions impacts a user’s ability to perceive, operate, and understand a
            website. When I decided to comb through the HTML file, I was overwhelmed by what was being presented to me.
            I couldn’t help but think that the website should have been set up into different portions such as headings,
            navigation sections, and footers. I noticed that styling was also intermixed with the HTML which also
            impacted my ability to read and make sense of the HTML structure. If a machine is going to comb through what
            I just read and spit that back out to the user, the website would come off as off-putting. The website,
            while visually dated, is something that the average user can navigate through but if someone where to rely
            on assistive technology, it would be something else.</p>
          <p>
            My recommendation is to add some type of structure to the HTML and add alternative texts to all links and
            images. The content of the actual page should be marked up with headings as well to denote a hierarchy
            within the page. I think it would help if the HTML file was sectioned in a way that the right and left
            navigation where separated as their own divs and the main content was marked up with headers. The tables are
            unnecessary and add to the confusion of the HTML file. By cleaning up the HTML, it will be a lot clearer for
            screen readers to read and present to users.</p>
