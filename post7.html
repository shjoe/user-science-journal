          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>In order to acclimate myself to <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/"
              target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, I’ve decided to track data on this user science journal. Google
            Analytics is a powerful tool that allows us as developers to track key metrics regarding website traffic and
            user information. We are then able to leverage that data to either make impactful decisions to our website
            or other business-related choices. I specifically chose this user science journal for this analytics
            research topic because it is a multi-page website that should in theory have a steady flow of traffic as it
            is shared in our class.</p>
          <h2>Set Up</h2>
          <p>In order to track analytics on this user science journal, I followed the instructions detailed in this
            <a href=" https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080" target="_blank">page</a>. Basically, as soon
            as you are finished signing up for Google Analytics as well as registering your chosen site, you are given a
            pre-made script that should be inserted after the “head” tag in (all) your HTML pages. Since I started this
            journal in early April 2019, Google Analytics have collected a little over a month and half of data.</p>
          <p>In order to stack up my knowledge of my user base for my user science journal I will be making the
            following assumptions:
            <ul>
              <li> All of the users who visit my page are from Washington State.</li>
              <li>75% of page visitors came from a referral through <a href=" https://seattleu.instructure.com/"
                  target="_blank">Seattle University’s Canvas portal</a>.</li>
              <li>The overall bounce rate for this website is around 50 percent given that user’s will only be
                interested
                in the current week’s topic and referrals would link a specific post.</li>
              <li>The average time on page will be less than 30 seconds (I don’t expect most visitors to stay long
                enough
                to read
                the entire article.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>Test 1: Where Are My Visitors From?</h2>
          <p>I was almost correct in my assumption that all my traffic came from people who reside in the state
            of
            Washington. Washington State accounted for 26 of 35 users, claiming 72.22% of my user base as well
            as 88.76%
            of all sessions. What is peculiar to me is that Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Texas, and even the District
            of
            Columbia accounted for one user each. Even more peculiar is that Virginia amounts to 16.67% of my
            user base
            and 6.74% of all sessions.</p>
          <p>As far as I know, the awareness out there regarding my journal is limited to Seattle University’s
            WATS
            program which is comprised of Washington State residents in the Seattle area as well as surrounding
            cities.
            I’m not sure how to explain these instances of users outside of Washington State other than someone
            was able
            to find the direct link through my through <a href="https://github.com/shjoe" target="_blank">my
              Github
              page</a> or a classmate happened to be browsing my journal while out of state. In the end my
            initial
            assumption while almost true, was ultimately wrong. Perhaps this says more about how things can be
            seen from
            anywhere in the world.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post7/user-regions.jpg" alt="Report on User Regions">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Lots of users from Washington State but why are there users from
            Virginia,
            D.C., Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Texas looking at my journal?</span>
          <h2>Test 2: How Did People Get Here?</h2>
          <p>Almost the inverse of my assumption is true here. I had guessed that 75% of users would come
            through Canvas but it turns out that 64.3% of users (27) come from direct as opposed to the
            35.7% (15) of users who clicked on a link to get to my page. It turns out my referrals came
            through Canvas and my Github page. Almost half of the direct views came from the <a
              href="https://www.shurenotjoe.com/user-science-journal/index.html" target="_blank"> index
              page</a>. I have to assume here that people either referred to my page in their address bar
            and was able to navigate to my page through the browser remembering my page URL or clicking a
            link to my page that was provided through email as Canvas also creates an email notification
            that contains the same message. So far, Google Analytics is showing me that my perceptions are
            incorrect.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post7/acquisition.jpg" alt="Report on Acquisitions via direct and
                      referral">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The split is almost 2/3 in favor of direct and 1/3 in favor of
            referral</span>
          <h2>Test 3 & 4: Bounce Rates and Average Time on Page</h2>
          <p>Finally got one! It makes sense for this page to have a bounce rate of almost half. At 49.44%, it puts me
            in line with my initial assumption. As our class has weekly topics that are brought forth through weekly
            journal entries, I don’t expect most of the users to refer to previous entries and if they do, it’s most
            likely that they started on the index and navigated to the topic of the week. Although, developers typically
            want a low bounce rate, I’m happy with my bounce rate. It tells me that half of the sessions include at
            least one interaction on a small scale website.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post7/bounce-time.jpg" alt="Report on Bounce Rate and Average Time on Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Bounce Rate: 49.44% & Average Time on Page: 1 minute and 33 seconds</span>
          <p>I figured that most people who would read my article would skim through it leading to a low average of 30
            seconds (this is being generous). It turns out that users on average spend 1 minute and 33 seconds. My
            lowball guess was due in part of the content as they are not full on research papers by no means. I would
            classify my weekly posts as a short and sweet introduction into that week’s topic. I even timed myself
            reading through <a href="https://www.shurenotjoe.com/user-science-journal/post6.html" target="_blank"> Post
              6</a> and I clocked in just shy of under 30 seconds. It turns out people are digesting
            my musings more than I give them credit for. Thanks guys!</p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>There are a lot of metrics to unpack in Google Analytics, but this brief review of my own website gave me a
            lot of perspective of who is visiting my page and what they are doing. I may not have assumed correctly, in
            fact only one of my assumption were correct, but I now know that:
            <ul>
              <li>While most of the users come from Washington State, I still have a few outliers out there in other
                states/territories.</li>
              <li>A lot of my traffic is direct, there is a good chance that users refer to my websites from their
                browsers remembering my URL.</li>
              <li>My bounce rate is 50/50, I would consider this a success or passing metric.</li>
              <li>Users are spending more time on my website than I would my own.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
